# WorldTradeSimulation
Python Model based on Prisioneers dilema that simulates the effects of a world divided trading blocks.

This is a Python implementation of a World Trade simulation based on the Prisoners’ dilemma, in which each country decides whether to a apply a protectionist or an open border policy on other countries exports.

After tuning the model with 1980-2020 data, two scenarios are simulated and compared: 
1) a globalized world scenario
2) a “crisis” scenario where the world is divided in two blocs each trading within.

The model estimates that the global wealth in a crisis scenario is 55% lower than in a globalization scenario by 2040 and that the “eastern” bloc, including China and India, is the most harmed.

The repository has two code files, one with a jupyter notebook and other standar python file.
